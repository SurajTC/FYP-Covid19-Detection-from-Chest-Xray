Check out the static version of the app [here](https://surajtc.github.io/FYP-Covid19-Detection-from-Chest-Xray/) :snowflake:

## Description

This is a Computer Aided Detection (CAD) tool for iterative Covid-19 detection,
along with the adequate description of its forming techniques which includes feature selection,
extraction and classification of neuro images to support the clinicians for early and more accurate
diagnosis. This takes a chest X-Ray Image as input and outputs a prediction among two classes:

* Normal/COVID-19 negative and 
* COVID-19 positive 

using the novel Deep Neural Network based model.
